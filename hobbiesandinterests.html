                <p> It is My favorite sport and I can play football all day without a meal. I role-play as a central midfielder and sometimes as an attacking Midfielder.
                    I love playing one touch and short passes with my closest team mate. My weakness is that am slow to execute what my brain wants once am on the pitch.

                <p>“Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.” – Martin Fowler
                   <P>“First, solve the problem. Then, write the code.” – John Johnson</p>
                    <p>“Experience is the name everyone gives to their mistakes.” – Oscar</p>
                    <p>The quotes above challenge me and always give me motivation to continue pursuing a career in programming
                        Unlike others who had passion ,I only got to love coding not long ago but I hope I am abe to write code that alll humans will understand

            <p>The ability to put on paper my imaginations and make fellow students and teachers feel like its a true story that ever happened sparked the Shakespeare in me <br>
                Despite tight schedules I will find a day or two in a week where I will write up something in my notebook. <br>They say am a great story teller but I believe am only great at TRansforming imaginations to reality.
               <br>Written a couple of notes and would consider having a go at writing in the near future. </p>
